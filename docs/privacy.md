# Privacy: what HyperSol WebSurfer 3D stores and sends

HyperSol WebSurfer 3D has no telemetry: no analytics, no crash reports, no
usage counts. This page lists everything it keeps on your computer and
everything it sends over the network. It is updated whenever that
changes (AGENTS.md rule 9).

Status: as of milestone 7 (2026-09-26): ad and tracker blocking and
encrypted DNS are on by default. The layers view (milestone 5) and the
instrument panel (milestone 7) send nothing anywhere.

## Blocked by default

The privacy shield blocks ad and tracker requests on every page, using
open filter lists and Ghostery's open-source blocking engine
(`@ghostery/adblocker`, MPL-2.0). It also hides page elements the lists
name as ads (element hiding). A page whose address is itself on a list
shows "The shield blocked this page", with "Open anyway" (that address,
once, in that tab). The shield at the bottom right counts what was
blocked on the page in front; click it to see the list and to pause the
shield on that site.

The lists (ads and trackers; no cookie-banner or annoyance lists),
downloaded from Ghostery's copies on GitHub, all under
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostery/adblocker/master/packages/adblocker/assets/`:

| List | Path | Licence | In the app's starter copy |
|---|---|---|---|
| EasyList | `easylist/easylist.txt` | GPL-3.0-or-later or CC BY-SA 3.0 or later | Yes |
| EasyPrivacy | `easylist/easyprivacy.txt` | same | Yes |
| uBlock Origin filters, and its 2020 to 2024 additions | `ublock-origin/filters.txt`, `filters-2020.txt` to `filters-2024.txt` | GPL-3.0 | Yes |
| uBlock Origin privacy | `ublock-origin/privacy.txt` | GPL-3.0 | Yes |
| uBlock Origin badware risks | `ublock-origin/badware.txt` | GPL-3.0 | Yes |
| uBlock Origin quick fixes, resource abuse, unbreak | `ublock-origin/quick-fixes.txt`, `resource-abuse.txt`, `unbreak.txt` | GPL-3.0 | Yes |
| Peter Lowe's ad and tracking server list | `peter-lowe/serverlist.txt` | None stated | No: downloaded only |
| uBlock Origin resources | `ublock-origin/resources.json` | GPL-3.0 | Yes |

The app includes a starter copy (`apps/browser/resources/filters/`,
rebuilt before each release with `pnpm filters:update`, which records
each list's address, size, and SHA-256 in `starter.json`), so pages are
protected from the first one, before anything is downloaded. Peter
Lowe's list states no licence, so it is not included in the app; it is
only downloaded by a refresh.

Known limit: some list entries replace a tracker's script with a
harmless stand-in. The stand-in did not load in Electron in our checks,
so those requests are blocked outright instead.

## Stored on your computer

Everything is in the app data folder, and nowhere else:

- Windows: `%APPDATA%\HyperSol WebSurfer 3D`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/HyperSol WebSurfer 3D`
- Linux: `~/.config/HyperSol WebSurfer 3D`

(Development and test runs use a separate throwaway folder, never this
one.)

| What | File | When it is written | How to delete it |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bookmarks | `hypersol.sqlite` | When you press the star or Ctrl+D | Remove them in the Library, or press the star again |
| History: each page's address, title, and time of visit | `hypersol.sqlite` | When a tab arrives at a page; the same page again in the same tab (a reload) adds nothing | Delete entries in the Library, "Clear all history", or Settings > Clear browsing data |
| Settings: search engine, what opens at startup, encrypted DNS mode, daily list updates on or off, sites where the shield is paused, whether pages open in the layers view, and the sites where you switched the layers view, the theme, the page tilt, and the instrument panel's switches | `settings.json` | When you change a setting, pause the shield on a site, or switch the layers view on a page | Delete the file; the defaults return. Settings > "Forget site choices" clears the layers view choices |
| Filter lists from the last update, and when they were downloaded | `filters/engine.bin`, `filters/engine.json` | After a list update | Delete the folder; the starter copy included in the app is used |
| Open tabs: their addresses and which one is in front | `session.json` | While you browse, shortly after tabs change | Reopened only when Settings > On startup is "Reopen your tabs from last time"; delete the file to forget them |
| Cookies, site storage, and cache | Chromium's profile files in the same folder | By the sites you visit, as in any browser | Settings > Clear browsing data |

If `settings.json` is damaged, it is renamed to
`settings.json.damaged-<date and time>` and kept for inspection, and the
defaults are used. If `hypersol.sqlite` cannot be opened, nothing is
recorded until it can be, and the Library says so.

The shield's per-page lists of what was blocked, the positions of the
images on the page in front (found for a later 3D feature), and the
instrument panel's readouts (each page's requests, console messages,
and the certificates Chromium checked, at most 300 of each) are kept in
memory only, and forgotten when the page or tab closes. The instrument
panel reads what the browser already sees; it makes no requests of its
own, and it leaves certificate checking to Chromium unchanged. If the saved filter lists are
damaged or were built by another version, the starter copy is used.

Not stored: form entries, passwords, downloads, and anything about how
you use the browser itself.

## Sent over the network

Only these. Everything except the list updates is started by you, and
the list updates can be turned off:

- The pages you open, including the images, scripts, and the favicon each
  page names (fetched through that page's own session, as a browser tab
  does; at most 256 KB, given up after 5 seconds, and cancelled when you
  leave the page).
- Searches typed in the address bar or start panel go to the search engine
  chosen in Settings (DuckDuckGo by default).
- DNS lookups for the sites you open go encrypted (DNS over HTTPS) to
  Quad9, `https://dns.quad9.net/dns-query`, a non-profit with a
  no-logging policy. Quad9 sees the names of the sites you visit; your
  network does not. Settings > Encrypted DNS: Secure (the default: Quad9
  only) or Automatic (Quad9 where possible, otherwise your network's
  DNS).
- If a site cannot be found while in Secure mode, the app asks Quad9 one
  question (about its own name, dns.quad9.net) to see whether Quad9 can
  be reached. If not, the page says "Encrypted DNS is blocked on this
  network" and offers "Use this network's DNS for now", which uses
  Automatic until you close the app.
- Filter list updates, when Settings > "Update the filter lists every
  day" is on (the default): once a day, the addresses in the table
  above, through the same encrypted DNS; a failed update keeps the lists
  in use and is tried again an hour later. "Update now" in Settings
  fetches them at once. Turn the switch off and nothing is downloaded
  unless you press "Update now".

Nothing else: no app update checks, no dictionary downloads (the spell
checker is off), no account, no sync.
