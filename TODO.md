Milestones 1 to 7 make up the first useful result in BRIEF.md.

### Where design work belongs

- Screen layout and navigation are built inside the feature milestone
  that needs them. The overall layout is already approved
  (ARCHITECTURE.md section 9), and each screen can only be judged with
  its real data: tab rail and shortcuts in 2, Library and Settings
  panels (with Escape to close) in 3, the shield in 4.
- Shared style starts as a small foundation task in milestone 1: one set
  of theme values feeds both the HUD's CSS variables and the Three.js
  materials, so no screen hard-codes a colour. Final colours and a design
  pass get their own milestone (6), because exact colours are still an
  open question and reviewing every real screen together keeps them
  consistent.
- Later polish goes after the first release (14), so it cannot delay a
  working browser.

## Milestone 1 — Live page in the 3D room

Status: Built 2026-09-25. Plan approved 2026-09-24; build approved
2026-09-24 (prompt 16). All tasks done. Waiting for the owner's
acceptance, with one known issue: check C2 is intermittent (see Check
results).

Goal: prove that a live web page tilted in 3D takes clicks, typing, and
scrolling correctly (ARCHITECTURE.md open question 2), and set up the
build and test tooling.

### Decisions (2026-09-24)

- The focused page is an Electron `<webview>` element inside the shell,
  placed by Three.js CSS3DRenderer. (`WebContentsView` is a flat native
  layer and cannot be transformed in 3D.) Every webview is locked down
  when it attaches.
- Fallback: if the tilted page fails the input checks, or its text is not
  readable at the default tilt, the focused page faces the viewer flat
  and fully sharp, with the 3D room around it. Only tab cards and
  transitions tilt. Texture mode stays the later upgrade path.
- Parallax pauses while the pointer is over the page and eases back over
  about 250 ms; it resumes over the room and is capped to a small range.
- Window: standard OS title bar. A custom frame is considered in
  milestone 6.
- Colours: provisional Nebula values only; final values in milestone 6.
- Waiting and error states in this milestone are plain text; styled
  cards arrive in milestone 2.

### Software installed (approved 2026-09-24, prompt 16)

Installed with pnpm 12.4.1 on 2026-09-24: electron 44.4.5, electron-vite
5.0.0, vite 7.3.6 (electron-vite 5 supports Vite 5 to 7, so not 8),
typescript 6.0.3 (typescript-eslint 8.70 supports TypeScript below 6.1,
so not 7), @types/node 26.6.2, three 0.186, @types/three 0.186, vitest
5.0.1, playwright 1.63.0 (library only; no browsers downloaded), eslint
10.11.0, typescript-eslint 8.70.1. Downloads performed: packages from the
npm registry, and the Electron 44.4.5 binary from Electron's GitHub
releases (Electron 44 has no install script; it fetches the binary on
first use and checks it against checksums shipped in the package).

### Tasks

- [x] 1. Workspace: pnpm workspace, `tsconfig.base.json`, `apps/browser`
      (electron-vite), skeleton `packages/scene-core` and
      `packages/themes`. Scripts: `dev`, `test`, `test:e2e`, `lint`,
      `typecheck`.
- [x] 2. Main process: single instance, one window with standard frame.
      Sandbox on, context isolation on, no Node in pages. On webview
      attach, replace any page-requested preload with the trusted page
      preload (an empty stub until milestone 5) and force safe web
      preferences. Narrow shell bridge.
- [x] 3. Room: Three.js scene with provisional Nebula background and
      lighting, fixed desk camera, CSS3D and WebGL layers stacked.
      Render on demand only (no redraws while idle).
- [x] 4. Page panel: `PagePanel` interface in scene-core; live webview
      panel with adjustable tilt (0° to 20°, default about 10°) and a
      glow edge.
- [x] 5. Parallax as decided above.
- [x] 6. Temporary plain address field (removed when the HUD lands in
      milestone 2) and a `--start-url` launch option for tests.
- [x] 7. Design task, style foundation: theme token schema in
      `@hypersol/themes` with provisional Nebula values; one value
      produces both a CSS variable and a Three.js colour.
- [x] 8. Spike: run the input checks at 0°, default, and 20°. Record the
      results; apply the flat-page fallback if they fail. Close open
      question 2 in ARCHITECTURE.md.
- [x] 9. better-sqlite3 check: from release listings, without installing,
      confirm prebuilt binaries for Electron 44 on Windows, macOS, and
      Linux (x64 and arm64). Record under open question 3.
      Result: checked node:sqlite first, as ARCHITECTURE.md asks. It
      works in Electron 44.4.5 (Node 24.21.0, SQLite 3.53.4): a table
      was created, written, and read back. The better-sqlite3 release
      listing was not checked, since it would not be needed. Switching
      milestone 3 to node:sqlite needs the owner's approval.
- [x] 10. Test harness: Vitest, Playwright Electron launcher, a local
      fixture server on 127.0.0.1 with a random port, and the sample
      pages below.
- [x] 11. Docs: README build and run, AGENTS.md Testing (only commands
      that ran), ARCHITECTURE.md, HANDOFF.md.

### Sample inputs (written by the agent, in `tests/fixtures/`)

- `click-grid.html`: 3×3 buttons (corners, edges, centre) that report
  which was hit.
- `form.html`: text input, textarea, select, checkbox.
- `long.html`: a tall page for scrolling.
- `link-a.html` and `link-b.html`: pages that link to each other.
- `hover.html`: a target that reports pointer enter and leave.
- `node-probe.html`: reports whether `require` or `process` exist.

### Checks

| # | Check | How | Expected result |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | App launches | Automated (Playwright) | Window opens, room renders, no console errors |
| C2 | Clicks land | Automated: all 9 grid buttons at 0°, default, 20°, at 2 window sizes | Every click hits the intended button |
| C3 | Parallax does not shift targets | Automated: move the pointer over the room, then click the grid | Parallax pauses over the page; all clicks land |
| C4 | Typing | Automated: click the field on the tilted page (real window routing), then type; keys are delivered to the page's view because Playwright's window-level keys do not reach a webview. Manual: real keyboard on a tilted page (owner, 2026-09-25) | Values match exactly |
| C5 | Scrolling | Automated: wheel over the page, then over the room | Page scrolls only when the pointer is over it |
| C6 | Hover and links | Automated | Hover reported; link loads the second page |
| C7 | Page isolation | Automated: `node-probe.html` | No Node access; any page-requested preload is replaced by the trusted stub |
| C8 | No unexpected traffic | Automated: log all requests during the run | Only 127.0.0.1 |
| C9 | Idle efficiency | Automated: count frames | No redraws while idle; about 60 fps during parallax |
| C10 | Load failure | Automated: stop the server, then load a page | Plain "couldn't load" text; app does not crash |
| C11 | Page crash | Automated: force the page's process to crash | App survives; message with Reload |
| C12 | Layout and style code | Vitest (unit) | Panel position and tilt correct; parallax cap and pause hold; one theme value yields matching CSS and 3D colour |
| C13 | Real sites | Manual, by the owner: Wikipedia, DuckDuckGo, YouTube | Text readable at the default tilt; video plays; parallax feels calm |
| C14 | Touch | Manual: tap and scroll | Works, or marked "not checked" without a touch screen |
| C15 | macOS and Linux | — | "Not checked" until milestone 7 |

### Check results (Windows 11, 2026-09-24)

Machine: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050 Laptop GPU plus AMD Radeon integrated
graphics, one 1920×1080 display at 100% scaling, touchpad, no touch
screen. Clicks in the automated checks are sent with Playwright's mouse
(Chrome DevTools Protocol, entering at the window), not OS input.

Latest results, 2026-09-25: 35 unit tests pass; lint and type check
clean. End-to-end: of the last 7 full runs, 5 passed 23 of 23 and 2 had
C2 failures; 1 of 3 further runs of C2 alone also failed (see C2).

| # | Result |
|---|---|
| C1 | Pass |
| C2 | Intermittent. When it passes, all 54 clicks land within 3 px of the target at 0°, 10°, and 20°, at 1280×800 and 1024×700. In some full runs, one click in the first seconds after a fresh launch on a tilted page never reaches the page (no pointer or mouse event at all) while the shell keeps focus on the webview. Not reproduced in 276 targeted clicks outside that window (back-to-back, after resizes, at delays of 0 to 1000 ms), and not seen by the owner in real use. Cause not found. Changes that did not remove it: waiting for the page to paint after load and after resize, and waiting for the window to have focus (both kept as fair preconditions). The grid page now records every pointer, mouse, and focus event, and C2 prints them when a click is missed. |
| C3 | Pass |
| C4 | Pass, with the method changed (see the Checks table). Playwright's keyboard, and Electron's input events sent to the window, never reached the page, tilted or flat. A real keyboard does: the owner typed into Wikipedia's search box on the tilted page (2026-09-25). The automated check keeps the real click routing and delivers the keys to the page's view. Gap: automated window-to-page keyboard routing is not covered; plan an OS-level input check with the per-OS checks in milestone 7. |
| C5 | Pass |
| C6 | Pass |
| C7 | Pass |
| C8 | Pass |
| C9 | Pass: no frames while idle; 60 to 69 frames per second during parallax across runs |
| C10 | Pass |
| C11 | Pass |
| C12 | Pass: 35 unit tests in 5 files |
| C13 | Owner, 2026-09-25: Wikipedia and other sites opened and typing worked; text looks a little blurry when tilted. Readability accepted; sharpness at the default 10° tilt to revisit in milestone 6. |
| C14 | Not checked: this machine has no touch screen |
| C15 | Not checked (milestone 7) |

Also found and handled: Chromium ignores input to a page until it has
painted, and "loaded" can come a moment earlier, so the tests wait for
the first paint before interacting.

### Spike result (task 8)

Answered 2026-09-25: the tilted live page works. Clicks, hover,
scrolling, links, and real keyboard typing all reach the page at the
default tilt, so the flat-page fallback is not needed. Text is slightly
soft when tilted (owner); the page is pixel-sharp only at 0°.

Regression list started by this milestone: C1 to C11.

### Done when

C1 to C12 pass (with the fallback in place if needed), the owner
accepts C13, the docs are updated, and the owner approves the finished
milestone.
